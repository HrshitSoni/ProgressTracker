#Progress Tracker
Progress Tracker is a WPF application that tracks and analyzes daily usage of various applications over a period of 7 days. It helps users monitor how much time they spend on specific apps each day and provides graphical insights for better productivity management.
##Features
###App Usage Tracking: Tracks the time specific applications are in focus and logs their usage data daily.
###Weekly Overview: Maintains data for the past 7 days, and automatically resets after a week.
###Graphical Reports: Provides visual representations of the daily and weekly app usage in a vertical bar graph format.
###App Management: Allows adding, viewing, and removing applications from the tracked list, with the appâ€™s name and icon displayed in the UI.
##How It Works
###Application Tracking: Once the tracker is running, it monitors the applications in use and records the time they are active.
###Time Reports: Each tracked app has a dedicated time page displaying detailed daily usage.
###Graph Reports: Provides a graphical view of application usage, allowing users to compare app usage over the past week.
###Data Lifecycle: Data is stored for 7 days and deleted automatically, ensuring lightweight and fresh information.
